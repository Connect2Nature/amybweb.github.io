<p>Connecting to the land and the people whom occupied it prior to the creation of territories, is important to the restorating of the land and healing of the people in the Puget Sound.  Too often you see a sign or monument that only shares the story through a colonial eye.  But what about the idigenious people whom lived off the land for thousands of years prior to the goverement stealing the land and creating the Washington Territories.  The Indian villages, battlefields, and other hostile historic events took place, and existed...just not in the way history, through the western colonial lens has been shared.
<br>
<p>My hope is we can expand our knowledge and understanding of the history in the Puget Sound area, and we can honor the Indian Warriors as they should have been honored, and together as one we can build a strong unified land stewardship.</p> 
<br>
 
<h2 class="major">What They Were Fighting For</h2>
<p>"The original treaty reservations averaged fewer than three quarters of an acre for each Indian.
"Whites could claim half that, 320 acres each, before the treaties even cleared the title.
The Stevens’ reservations for Squaxin and Nisqually had no drinking water, no salmon bearing
streams, no pastures for the large herds of Nisqually horses. Three quarters of an acre of gravel
soil could never have sustained even a decent garden.</p>

<p>The reservation that Steven designated for Puyallup in what is now downtown Tacoma, was no
better. It would never have supported the large population that would eventually locate there.
Our chiefs knew that we would have all starved to death." (KingGeorge)</p>

<p>"Stevens was a West Point Academy trained engineer and knew that moving to the Medicine
Creek reservations would exterminate our people. George Gibbs, one of the only reasonable
white men at the treaty council, reported that Stevens was drunk. Either Stevens was drunk
or intended for all of us to die or both. This small man seriously underestimated the Indian people."(KingGeorge)</p>

<h2 class="major">Survival Threatened</h2>


		<p>Settlers arrived ready to cultivate the land, damn the rivers, and build homesteads and cities.  The negative impact this had on the Native Americans that depended on the land and had spiritual and cultural connections to it, was severe.  In response to the threat, the Native Americans had no other choice but to fight to protect the land and their way of living. 
		<br>
		<p>The 1st map below: Identifies current fish blockages.  One can connect these blockages to development very easily.  Roads and buildings redirected the water flows.  Thus impacting the survival of the fish that spawn in the creaks, streams, and rivers. As well the chain reaction the decline of salmon has on the eco-system that surrounds it. </p>
		<p>This had a rippling effect across the landscape and changed the ecolgoy in most of the prairie areas.  The 2nd map identifies where prairies would have been located. There were many traditional foods that were harvested from these prairies that were also lost.  As well as the traditional land managment practices, such as traditional burning.

		<center><span class="image main"><img src="Lab5/images/AR_mapindianwar1856a.jpg"/></span></center></p>
		
<p>December 24-26, 1854 Nisqually Delta, Medicine Creek Treaty Tree</p> 

<p>October 24, 1855 Muck Creek, Now JBLM</p>

<p>October 27, 1855 Connell’s Prairie </p>

<p>October 28, 1855 Soos Creek, ʔilalqʷu , Brannan and adjacent “homesteads” </p>

<p>November 24-26, 1855 Bittings Prairie </p>

 


<p>December 4, 1855, Brannan “Homestead” North of ʔilalqʷu </p>

<p>January 5, 1856, Fox Island </p>

<p>January 26, 1856, Allied forces attack Seattle. Little loss of life, a great deal of terror on the part of the “settlers.” </p>


<p>February13, 1856, White River Bar: Battle. Paul Weyallup and Mowitch endured hardship. “We had a hard time to get our land.” </p>

 

<p>February15, 1856, Green River: Patkanim and lower Snoqualmie mercenaries killed Diakud, his daughter and a Sowahaid on the Green. Leschi and Patkanim exchange words. Snoqualmies didn’t bring enough to eat, go home, expecting a paycheck. </p>


<p>February 29, 1856, Elhi Hill, Lemmon’s Prairie: Keyes men with the help of (unwilling) “scout” Burnt Charlie, kill Chief Kanasket as he is descending Elhi hill. He is mutilated or as family said, crucified. An apt description as Kanasket died so his people would live. </p>

 

<p>March 10, 1856 Battle of Connell’s Prairie: (Followed by the exodus across Naches Pass, summering north of Ellensburg) 
	<br>
Last engagement, Qualchan and his warriors came from the Wenas to help. Afterwards counseled that Leschi and his people return with them.  Shortly after, Leschi, Kanasket’s widow, many others, travel across Naches Pass. Women and children died along the way. Kamiakin feeds them when they arrive, eventually staying for the summer just north of Ellensburg. Che lo an. 
</p>
 
<p>March 28 – April 1, 1956, Mashel River: Maxon’s “volunteers” murder Nisqually women, children and old men on the Mashel river </p>

<p>?, 1956, East Side of the Mountains: Leschi, Kitsap and others make peace with Col.Wright </p>

<p>August 5, 2016, Fox Island: Governor Stevens announced that Nisqually, Puyallup and Muckleshoot land would be returned.  

<p>November 13, 1856: Betrayal of Leschi by Sluggia</p>

<p>February 19, 1858, Prairie above Steilacoom: Lynching of Chief Leschi. (The area is built over, historic photos exit. A monument was erected at a strip mall nearby.) </p>
 
<p>September 24, 1858, Latah Creek near Spokane: Lynching of Qualchan (We won’t film. Sacred site.) </p>

 <p>Soon after, murder of Chief Owhi near Starbuck,WA </p>

 

"August 5, 1856 is a day to celebrate. It is one of the only times in the history of the United States that Indians went to war to get their land back and did get their land back. We as Indian people have sustained ourselves with a sharp sense of humor. I don’t think Governor Stevens knew he was writing such comic material when he announced, in words that have become very familiar to Indian people in dealing with white leaders: 
<br>
And finally, the words that changed our future: 
You shall have a large reservation at Nisqually, one large reservation on the Puyaloop. Those reservations shall give you ground enough for horses and to the Horse Indians, Muckleshook I will give land between White and Green Rivers and I will send a man with you to mark out the ground so that you may be satisfied. 
<br>
Our warriors’ efforts returned 25,000 acres of our land to Our People: 17,000 acres to the Puyallup reservation, almost 4,000 acres were restored to the Nisqually reservation and the Muckleshoots reclaimed nearly 4,000 acres of our land after zero had been reserved for us." (KingGeorge)
