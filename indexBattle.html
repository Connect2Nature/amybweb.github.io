								<p>This is Our Story. It is the story of a family of fearless warriors who were
related by blood in a great circle that linked the Nisqually villages, the Puyallups, Muckleshoots,
and joined by our Upper Snoqualmie and Wenatchi relatives. We would have never been
successful without the legendary warriors and strategists of the Weowicht dynasty including
Owhi, Kamiakin and Qualchan, joined by the Weyallup family from Selah and circling back
along the Naches River, over the Cascades and closing the circle at Nisqually.</p>

<p>White people have told their story and some have even tried to tell ours. Muckleshoots have an
expression for that. “It’s your lie, you can tell it any way you want.” The white accounts have
one big lie in common. They say that the Indians lost the war.
It is time that Our Story is told: The story of our courage, strength and ultimate success. That we
went to war to get our land back and we got it back. It is long passed time that we properly honor
our warriors and express our gratitude to their families.</p>

<p>War was declared on us at the Medicine Creek Treaty Council when a short, self-important
tyrant named Stevens presented a treaty to our people taking all our land for no money paid, that
reserved just 2 sections of our land for Squaxin, 2 sections of our land for the Nisquallies and 2
sections of our land for all the Puyallups. And ZERO acres for Muckleshoot. A month later, at
the Point Elliott treaty council, ZERO land was reserved for Muckleshoot.
The original treaty reservations averaged fewer than three quarters of an acre for each one us.
Whites could claim half that, 320 acres each, before the treaties even cleared the title.
The Stevens’ reservations for Squaxin and Nisqually had no drinking water, no salmon bearing
streams, no pastures for the large herds of Nisqually horses. Three quarters of an acre of gravel
soil could never have sustained even a decent garden.
The reservation that Steven designated for Puyallup in what is now downtown Tacoma, was no
better. It would never have supported the large population that would eventually locate there.
Our chiefs knew that we would have all starved to death.</p>

<p>Stevens was a West Point Academy trained engineer and knew that moving to the Medicine
Creek reservations would exterminate our people. George Gibbs, one of the only reasonable
white men at the treaty council, reported that Stevens was drunk. Dr. Barbara Lane told me
personally that the weight of the evidence supports Gibbs’ observation. Either Stevens was drunk
or intended for all of us to die or both.
This small man seriously underestimated Our People. His ignorance and arrogance left our
leaders with only one choice: “To do what we do best and fight for what is ours.”
</p>

<h2 class="major">Our Land</h2>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>


								<p>Our warriors’ efforts returned 25,000 acres of our land to Our People: 17,000 acres to the
Puyallup reservation, almost 4,000 acres were restored to the Nisqually reservation and the
Muckleshoots reclaimed nearly 4,000 acres of our land after zero had been reserved for us.
This film is dedicated to our warriors and their wives and families who answered the call to fight
for the return of our land and who succeeded in securing its return.
We won our first treaty war and the descendants of the first treaty war fought together-our
cousins at Nisqually, Puyallup and Muckleshoot-and won our second treaty war and secured our
treaty right to fish.
Listen and remember the words of our Chief, Leschi:
Whatever the future holds, do not forget who you are. Teach your children, teach
your children’s children. Teach them the pride of a great people…A time will
come again when they will celebrate together with joy. When that happens, my
spirit will be there with you.</p>

								<p>Leschi was as good a friend as we ever had. He was dignified in his intercourse
and proud of his country, and, I may say, proud of himself. He had a benevolent
countenance that unmistakably stamped him as a good man. Leschi told me
before going to the war that the Indians would not hurt any of the settlers, and
advised us to stay on our farms, which we did. I never was afraid to go wherever I
wanted to during the war and did as I wished, and was never molested….
Stevens wanted me to go into the war, but I wouldn’t do it. I knew it was his bad
management that brought on the war, and I wouldn’t raise a gun against those
people who had always been so kind to us when we were so weak and needy. The
Indians could have killed us all at any time during the eight years we were here
before Governor Stevens came, but instead of molesting us in any way they
helped us all they could. Owen Bush to Ezra Meeker, Pioneer Reminiscences.
James McAllister was one of those “weak and needy” settlers who had been squatting for over
ten years on Nisqually land. He wrote a letter to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for
Washington Territory claiming:
From the most reliable Indians that we have in this country, we have information
and are satisfied that Leschi, a sub-chief and half Clickitat is and has been doing
all that he could possibly do to unite the Indians of this country to raise against the
Whites in a hostile manner and has had some join in with him already. Sir, I am of
the opinion that he should be attended to as soon as convenient for fear that he
might do something bad. Let his arrangements be stopped at once. Your attention
to the above will be exceedingly appreciated by the people of Nisqually bottoms.
109
Acting Governor Mason responded to McAllister’s letter by authorizing a militia to be called
Eaton’s Rangers. “
Should you meet any unusual or suspicious assemblage of Indians, you will
disarm them, and should they resist, disperse them, and put any who resist or use
violence to death, or send them to Fort Steilacoom in irons, or bound as you may
deem best.
McAllister joined the rangers who promptly commenced the first military act of war. On October
24, 1855, armed with orders to kill resisters. They charged out to Chief Leschi’s home at Muck
Creek to arrest Leschi and his brother Quiemuth. The brothers were already gone. McAllister and
Connell continued the pursuit from Muck Creek to one of Muckleshoot’s agriculturally rich
prairies. Connell had been squatting on our land and destroying our wild blueberry crop. On
October 27, my uncle Tu-wa-pa-ti, took out McAllister. We also killed Connell.
The next day, October 28, 1855 my Muckleshoot people took the opportunity to settle some
scores in our backyard. White people are good at propaganda. Whenever Indians kill white
people they call it a massacre, erect a monument and name streets, parks, and buildings for their
dead. That’s how we came to have Brannan Park.
When whites first showed up in our territory, our Old Ones fed them and expected them to be on
their way. But they didn’t leave. They cut our timber, shot our game, took fish from our river.
They treated us like slaves, abused our women. None of the Muckleshoot land’s title had been
cleared before the war. The treaty that ceded the land where Auburn now stands wasn’t ratified
until 1859. So the “settlers” we killed that day were all illegal trespassers. But we didn’t kill all
the settlers, just the ones who had treated us the worst.
An aggressive squatter named William Brannan had the audacity to stake his “claim” adjacent
and downriver from our main town of Ilalqo. That put him in a position to be able cork off our
salmon run. Chief Nelson personally warned him to leave the day before, but he was too arrogant
or too stupid to heed the warning. My Soos and Ilalqo people were closely related. They took
care of this business.
At the end of the war, Stevens wanted to execute Chiefs Nelson, Leschi, Quiemuth and Kitsap.
He could never catch Nelson, but even if he had, Stevens admitted the illegality of the actions
against the Muckleshoot, in a letter to Col. George Wright (October 4, 1856), “ All belong to
bands with whom treaties have been made, and in the case of all, except Nelson, the treaty has
been sanctioned by the Senate, and the execution of the treaty has been placed in my hand.”
This is the Green River Valley, better described as the Valley of the Warriors- the impenetrable
home of our Green River warriors. Just a couple of miles upriver from Soos village is the site of
Burns Creek village. This is where Chief Leschi and his people were welcomed by his
Muckleshoot relatives to make a base camp for the five month duration of the war. Kitsap and
Kanasket both had homes further upstream near Newhauken Creek. The descendants of Kitsap,
Kanasket and Nelson are hundreds strong at Muckleshoot to this day.
Three days after the Muckleshoots dispatched the unwelcome neighbors at what is now Auburn,
puyuyux̌ and his brothers killed two militia men in a place that became known as Finnell’s
swamp. Not far from here is the place that Thunder became the protector of the Puyallup people
in war. Thunder kept its promise and many of the Puyallup warriors survived the war, lived to be
110
old men, and left many descendants. puyuyux̌ was the father of Jimmie Cross’s wife Deephop
and Tyee Dick’s wife Lucy.
By itself, the death of these militia men was not a remarkable event, as we were now in full war.
But Stevens later used the death of Moses as a tool for his personal vendetta against our good
chiefs. Chief Leschi and Quiemuth were later indicted for killing this man who had taken up
arms against Our People. Quiemuth was then murdered while in custody. Chief Leschi was
lynched after his second “trial” that was based on perjured testimony.
Leschi and Quiemuth did not kill either man. They never betrayed those who did. No one was
ever tried for the murders of our warriors or the murders of our women, children and old ones.
On November 3, 1855 soldiers tried to ford the White River. The white accounts demonstrate
almost complete ignorance of the Muckleshoots and little knowledge of the Puyallup warriors. If
they had known us, they would have known they would not be crossing the White. The Creator
made this river for us. The salmon were put in the river for us and we were put here to take care
of the salmon. Frightened soldiers boasted of killing lots of our people that day. Instead, they
wasted a lot of ammunition.
I enjoyed Ezra Meeker's recollection of the story as told by Tyee Dick.
[…] [T]hey lost but one man[…]the battle was 'hi-ue he-he, hi-ue he-he' (lots and
lots of fun.) The Indians […] began to push up hats and sticks […] and bang,
bang, bang would go the guns of the enemy, down would go the hat and another
Indian reported killed. This […] brought yells of delight from the Indians all
along the line.
Tyee Dick's granddaughter, Cora Richards Brown has many descendants to this day at the
Puyallup Tribe.
The next skirmish of the war took place below what is now Bonney Lake, not far from sqʷəәspł
village, home of Kitsap's younger brother quoyəәpqəәd or Tommy Lane, who has many
descendants at Puyallup Tribe today.
H.H. Bancroft described it this way,
Upon the march, which began on the 24th of November, Slaughter was attacked
at night at Biddings prairie, one mile from the Puyallup, and sustained a loss of
forty horses during a heavy fog which concealed the movements of the Indians.
[…] On the morning of the 26th E. G. Price of Wallace's company, while
attending to camp duty, was shot and killed by a lurking foe.
The chiefs who commanded in the attack on the night of the 25th were Kitsap and
Kanascut of the Klikitats, Quiemuth and Klowowit of the Nisquallies, and Nelson
of the Green River and Niscope Indians. During two nights that the troops were
encamped on this prairie the Indians continually harassed them by their yells, and
by crawling up out of the woods which surrounded the little plain, and under
cover of the fog coming close enough to fire into camp in spite of the sentries,
who discharged their pieces into the surrounding gloom without effect.
The forty horses were payback for the theft of Leschi’s stock by the militia the previous month.
111
All our warriors carried tubšadad or warrior power. Our word tubšəәdəәʔ means people from East
of the mountains. All of the prominent warriors of our first treaty war carried tubšəәdəәʔ blood,
tubšadad power as well as others powers that helped them in war like calling in heavy fog or
thunder when needed.
On December 4, 1855 the soldiers camped just north of our main Muckleshoot village of Ilalqo
on the “Brannan Homestead.” We thought we had made it clear on October 28, that trespassers
were not welcome, but the soldiers returned to the same site, with the same result. The traitor
John Haiton was traveling with the soldiers as “a guide”. That evening, Lt. Slaughter foolishly
allowed himself to be illuminated by their cooking fire. Haiton warned Slaughter that we were
present and then Haiton had the good sense to duck. Lt. Slaughter refused to believe him and
Sasticum and Paul Weyallup took out Slaughter.
Our sharpshooters were powerful and honorable men. They were later allotted choice land on the
Puyallup reservation, lived long lives and left successful families. The Sasticum name is proudly
carried today at Puyallup. Paul Weyallup’s stepdaughter, Susan Ashue Young, was the matriarch
of one of the Puyallup Tribe’s largest families. Paul Weyallup’s descendants through his sons
include tribal historian Marlene Spencer Simla and many others on the Yakama reservation.
Chief Leschi had worked tirelessly to prevent the war and he continued his peace efforts
throughout the war. On January 5, 1856, he visited one of the concentration camps where whites
herded Indians for the duration of the war. Leschi’s mere presence on Fox Island, being so close
to a main center of white military activity at Steilacoom, set off the opposite effect. Nisqually
historian Cecelia Carpenter wrote, “When the message arrived at Steilacoom [sent by Agent John
Swan] that Leschi had landed on the island [it] sent the citizenry and the army into a panic unlike
any other event of the war.”
Quite simply, the whites were terrified of the consequences, that were sure to result, from their
own bad behavior.
They brought the Ten Commandments with them, forced them on us, and then they violated
them.
Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal, bear
false witness against thy neighbour, covet thy neighbour’s house, covet thy
neighbour’s wife, manservant, maidservant, nor his ox, ass, nor any thing that is
thy neighbour’s.
Ezra Meeker said “…the Indians living on the upper reaches of the Green, White, Puyallup and
Nisqually Rivers….were wide awake Indians and were the tribes that went on the warpath.” We
refused to go to concentration camps.
The “Attack on Seattle” occurred on January 26, 1856. I want to share a portion of the
description by A.J. Splawn from his book, Ka-mi-akin, The Last Hero of the Yakimas.
About the middle of January, 1856, a worn and weary Indian arrived at Ow-hi’s
village, having crossed the Cascades on snowshoes. He bore a message from
Chief Leschi asking that a band of warriors be sent him to aid in his contemplated
attack upon Seattle. Leschi was closely related to the Yakimas, his mother having
been a daughter of Chief We-ow-wicht. He and Qualchan, therefore, were
cousins.
112
At the council which Ow-hi called, Qualchan offered to lead some braves over the
mountains. About one hundred men were ready to go and they were soon on their
way. When they got as far as Ka-sit-kees (Easton), their horses had to be sent
back on account of the deep snow. The warriors, proceeding on snowshoes,
reached Leschi’s camp the fourth day out. Here they found about 300 warriors
under the leadership of Leschi and Coquilton near Lake Washington, awaiting the
arrival of their Yakima relatives before making the attack.
We learned that day that our weapons were no match for cannon and howitzer fire. During the
day-long skirmish we killed two, terrified everyone, and succeeded in making our point.
The whites had no luck penetrating the Valley of the Warriors, our Green River stronghold, so
they hired Pat Kanim and his people to fight their fight for them. On February 15, 1856, Pat
Kanim’s bunch killed Diakud and his little daughter, beheaded them and sold their heads to the
whites.
A week before, Pat Kanim turned on his own people, bowed down to the soldiers, and turned
over two good men, Hoptowit and Skwai-kwi, who were hung on the prairie just south of Toltxʷ,
now known as “Carnation".
Thomas Jefferson, son of King George of the S’Klallams, eloquently expressed my own feelings
about Pat Kanim in a letter he wrote in 1917,
And in reference to Pat Kanim he fought against his own kind, fought and helped
the white people and maybe fought against his own relations. What has he got to
show today for what he did? I don’t believe he received any pensions, not even a
monument at his grave. I mention Pat Kanim because he was my uncle by law. He
married my Aunt.
Kanasket was crucified by soldiers near the foot of Elhi Hill on February 29, 1856. Kanasket's
power told him that he was going to die that day. He was not afraid of death but the soldiers were
terrified of him. Pashniki and his brother, Quatskanim, were aides to their uncle Kanasket.
Phillip Starr's father accompanied his uncle Kanasket that morning, but managed to escape.
Afterward, they wrote gruesome descriptions of the strength of Kanasket’s body and of his
hatred for the whites, who had caused Our People so much needless suffering. Kanasket did not
live to see the return of Our Land, but his family did. Kanasket left two daughters, Annie Nason
and Lucy Paimes. Most of Annie's family are still at Muckleshoot and include the Calvert,
Hungary and Fred Lane families. Lucy married a Puyallup allottee. Their son, Edward Paimes,
married Joe and Lucy Bill's daughter from Muckleshoot. Their daughter Lillian left the Hoffers,
and Vernon Louis and Dr. Verna Bartlett's family who are Puyallup. Kanasket is uncle to all the
Starr's, to the Bob James family that includes my Anderson cousins and Councilman Jeremy
James. Many nieces and nephews descend from Kanasket's Wenatchi siblings, most of whom are
members of the Colville Tribes. Their strength and accomplishments continue to make all of us
stronger as Indian People.
The Stuck River was the site of the Muckleshoot protest fishery during our second treaty war.
We should probably not have been surprised when we realized that the warriors of the second
treaty wars were direct descendants of the warriors of the first treaty war. The Willie Frank
family comes from Chief Martin’s warrior family. Ramona Bennett comes from Iyakama. Cecil
113
Moses, our Muckleshoot fish war chief came from Kitsap. Those are just a few examples and
soon we need to tell story of our second treaty war as well.
The Stuck River channel runs from Auburn’s Game Farm Park to Sumner. In our language, the
name for the Stuck River is stux̌ʷ, meaning "plowed through." After the ice age, two whales
plowed through from Lake Puyallup to the salt water. When the lake drained, the Stuck River
channel remained. The White River runs down this channel today, joining the Puyallup at
Sumner. But at the time of the war, the main channel of the White River swung north at Game
Farm, right through what is now Auburn, joining the Green River at our main Muckleshoot town
of Ilalqo, continuing north as the White River and eventually becoming the Duwamish. It is
important to understand how the river has been changed in order to understand the accounts of
the war.
On a march up the Stuck River Valley, at White River Crossing, the Nisqually warrior Yetakh,
shot A.V. Kautz in the leg on March 1, 1856. Yetakh was the great-grandfather of the Kautz
boys. Yetakh and A.V. Kautz were on good terms with each other and there were no hard
feelings over the shooting. A.V. Kautz later did his best to prove that Leschi was innocent of the
crime for which he was eventually hung.
Our People must never again forget to honor our relatives from east of the mountains for the
sacrifice they made in our time of need and while they were still engaged in their own war. It
was the second time that Qualchan and warriors answered our call.
[W]hen about the first of March, 1856, an Indian runner from Puget Sound came
to Ow-hi's village on the Wenas with word from Leschi that the soldiers were
pressing his people so hard that they had time neither to rest nor sleep, Qual-chan
and E-ne-as set out at once with fifty braves via the Nah-cheez pass. …they found
Leschi, Stehi and Qui-em-uth with about 300 warriors, skirmishing with Col.
Casey's command.” A.J. Splawn
This brief battle was said to be our last engagement with the U.S. regulars, on this side of the
mountains.
We would yet have to contend with the militia: Steven’s private army.
While we enjoyed many military victories during the war and were ultimately victorious in
regaining our land, it was a time of great suffering for our people. Luplupton told his family he
went ten days without food at the end of the war. Paul Weyallup said simply: “My son, we had a
hard time to get our land here.”
The Boise Creek and South Prairie Creek villages were located at an Indian crossroads where the
Muckleshoot trail, Puyallup trail and Nisqually trail converged into the Naches Trail. It was a
place that became too dangerous to live as a result of the war. This community included
Kanasket and his brother Wakatai as well as my grandmother Mary tsubulshed, from whom all
the James Daniels family descend, her brother Mowitch Man, her sister ts-le̓-le-wat who was
George Nelson’s wife, her cousins Deehop from whom the Cross family descends, and tsi da bał
who was Phillip Starr’s mother.
Charlie Ashue told a story of his father’s valor during a skirmish at Boise Creek near our White
River hatchery.
114
A small group of our people had secreted themselves from the soldiers and were
encamped there. My father had an injury to his back and was leaning against an
alder tree when the solders, unseen by him crept up behind. When he saw the
soldiers knock the old people down he said to Mowitch Man: “Snatch up your boy
and run, you first and I last” The old man seized his boy and ran to safety.
My father fired one shot and leaped across a small stream of water. One leg went
down in the mud and he lay there. A soldier came and pricked him with his
bayonet. The soldier could barely reach him. My father never moved. The soldier
said, “Well, he is dead. It is no use to shoot a dead man.” My father looked. He
worked his leg out of the mire, he ran behind a snag, he fired; he got his man. He
had now got two of the soldiers, having killed one the first time he fired. He took
two rolls of blankets belonging to the dead soldiers. The soldiers had burned the
blankets and food of the Indian camp. The two Indian survivors charged and
slaughtered the soldiers. They tormented the soldiers all night until they had to get
up and leave. The Indians took all their food and blankets; they made it even. That
night they killed a lot of soldiers. Mowitch Man’s brother and wife and son were
killed. John Haiton was the informer who showed the soldiers where our people
were.”
Accounts of the war contain many inconsistencies and uncertainties with respect to dates, place
names, participants and casualties. For instance, a number of whites claimed credit for the
wounds inflicted on Shot Mouth Charlie Sheadshut during the war. Joe Young said the shooter
was John Haiton. Joe Young’s maternal grandmother, one of Paul Weyallup’s wives, was related
to Haiton and that kinship spared him the retaliation he deserved. Forty-five years after the war,
white boys in Tacoma shot Charlie Sheadshut in the back of the neck as he and his family were
camped near Commencement Bay. The old warrior refused to prosecute, saying only, “if it had
been one of his children that had been hit, instead of himself, the child would have been killed.”
The war has never been over for our people; it still goes on today.
On March 10, 1856 the fighting returned for the last time to Connell’s Prairie.
A.J. Splawn gathered the stories of the old people, telling of the clash with the
militia and of our own Trail of Tears across the ice-encrusted snow of Naches
Pass.
The two forces were about equal, the fight, which raged all day, resulting in a
drawn battle. The Indians had seven killed and about twenty wounded. At a
council held that night, Qual-chan expressed the opinion that further fighting
would be useless. "Today's fight has convinced me, "he said, "that you cannot
cope with the whites. I noticed reinforcements constantly arriving in the camp of
the enemy, and these will continue, whereas you have the greater portion of your
fighting men now on the ground. I advise you to move all your people at once to
the Yakima valley.
It was decided to act upon this advice and the retreat began at once. These people
had made their brave fight; their last stand for their homes against a fate too
strong for them. Worn and weary they took their way, with what little food they
had hastily gathered the morning after the battle, over the snow and across the icy
streams. In that dreadful retreat over the winter mountains, many old men and
115
women and little children perished by the wayside and were buried in the snow.
The wails of the women and the crying of the children touched even the stout
heart of Qual-chan who said to his friend E-ne-as, "The suffering of these people,
caused by the whites, has determined me never to surrender or quit fighting them
so long as I live." He kept his word.
Our people were fed and cared for by their Weowicht relatives of the Kamiakin and Owhi
families. We entered into a peace treaty with Col. George Wright. For the warriors and the US
military, the war had ended.
But the tiny tyrant Stevens had missed most of the war while off making treaties with the
Blackfeet, Coeur d’Alenes, Quinaults and others. When he was able to turn his full attention to
Puget Sound, he proceeded to create his own war, fought by his own private army. Our warriors
had already withdrawn to the east, so Stevens declared open season on those who were left.
Stevens turned his wrath on the “Muck Creek Men,” former Hudson Bay Company employees
who had married Indian women. Stevens authorized his pet volunteer, “Captain” Maxon, to
arrest these farmers for treason, including John McCloud, the patriarch of hundreds of Nisqually
and Puyallup descendants.
Historian and teacher, Abbi Wonacott, has written the most complete account we have of the
massacre of old men, women and children who had sought refuge near Chief Leschi’s birth
village on the Mashel River, beginning March 30, 1856.
Nisqually warrior Charlie Martin said,
The father and uncle of Mrs. Alice James were killed at Mashelle by soldiers.
There were five or six killed at that time, three men and two women. The names
of the men killed Pah-tah-tah, To-bol-hweet-sa and Lu-khaladkh. To-bol-hweetsa
was the father of Butcher Sam, a fighter. Those people at Mashelle had slipped
around to an unfrequented place in order to be out of the way of the soldiers.
Sam McShell or Butcher Sam and Alice James were both later allotted at Puyallup. Sam McShell
is buried in the Cushman cemetery. Alice James moved to the Nisqually reservation after the
forced sale of the Puyallup allotments.
The depredations against our people did not end. Soldiers murdered the father of George
Yaniquish and his brother Itawis. The old man was a cripple. There are many descendants of this
family today including the Andersons, Heather Hull, the Clara Squally John family and the
Nelsons from Alice Hanson.
August 5, 1856 is a day to celebrate. It is one of the only times in the history of the United States
that Indians went to war to get their land back and did get their land back. We as Indian people
have sustained ourselves with a sharp sense of humor. I don’t think Governor Stevens knew he
was writing such comic material when he announced, in words that have become very familiar to
Indian people in dealing with white leaders:
“I believe there will be no lying. I am sure I will try not to lie.”
Then he said this was all our fault:
Those Res[ervations] were suggested by yourselves. I had those reserves
surveyed. I found them not good. I sent word to Leshi that those Res[ervations]
116
were not good and your brother Col. Simmons told all the Indians that the
reserves should be changed.
And finally, the words that changed our future:
You shall have a large reservation at Nisqually, one large reservation on the
Puyaloop. Those reservations shall give you ground enough for horses and to the
Horse Indians, Muckleshook I will give land between White and Green Rivers
and I will send a man with you to mark out the ground so that you may be

								<p>Listen and remember the words of our Chief, Leschi:
Whatever the future holds, do not forget who you are. Teach your children, teach
your children’s children. Teach them the pride of a great people…A time will
come again when they will celebrate together with joy. When that happens, my
spirit will be there with you.
